Open your git: . git remote add upstream https://github.com/upstream/repo.git . When you want to sync the changes from upstream . git pull --rebase upstream master . git push --force-with-lease origin master . I highly recommend that you make new branch for each changes, so you can work on something else while other PR is still waiting for approval. . Before creating a new branch, pull the changes from upstream. Your master needs to be up to date. . git pull . Create the branch on your local machine and switch in this branch : . git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch] . Push the branch on github : . git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch] . I use GitHub Desktop which is easy to use for overall. .",
