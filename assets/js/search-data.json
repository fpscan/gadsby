There may be more than one way to achieve this, and it can be divided into paid or non-paid or fast or compatibility.What can we do? We can add intro to the beginning of more than one video using FFmpeg. For this we need FFmpeg and a smooth folder structure so we can work more efficiently. . Folder Structure . Why is this important? Because working in a tidy environment is critical to efficiency and success. So the Folder Structure should be like this; . input(folder) &gt; the videos we have will store here output(folder) &gt; the videos we will get with intro file will be there intro(video file) run.bat &gt; the script we will use . So this how it suppose to look; . . Script . First you need to have FFmpeg and you need to add into your path in order to use it globally. . How to do that? . Unzip the FFmpeg to your C: drive. | Then there will be bin folder, copy the folder path | Right Click to Computer &gt; Properties &gt; Advanced System Settings &gt; Environment Variables &gt; System Variables &gt; Edit then Add C: ffmpeg bin to this list | Make a file as run.bat then right click and edit with Sublime Text or any other capable software or save it as .txt and edit with notepad then you can change extension back to .bat file. . SET RESOLUTION=&quot;1920:1080&quot; SET INPUT_FOLDER=&quot;input&quot; SET INTRO=&quot;intro.mov&quot; SET OUTPUT_FOLDER=&quot;output&quot; for %%a in (&quot;%INPUT_FOLDER% *.*&quot;) do ffmpeg -i %INTRO% -i &quot;%%a&quot; -filter_complex &quot;[0:v]scale=%RESOLUTION%:force_original_aspect_ratio=1,pad=%RESOLUTION%:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2[v0]; [1:v]scale=%RESOLUTION%:force_original_aspect_ratio=1,pad=%RESOLUTION%:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2[v1]; [v0][0:a][v1][1:a]concat=n=2:v=1:a=1[v][a]&quot; -map [v] -map [a] &quot;%OUTPUT_FOLDER% %%~na.mp4&quot; . So what it does? . SET RESOLUTION=&quot;1920:1080&quot; is force the resolution 1080p . SET INPUT_FOLDER=&quot;input&quot; is the locate the place for your input folder .

Open your git: . git remote add upstream https://github.com/upstream/repo.git . When you want to sync the changes from upstream . git pull --rebase upstream master . git push --force-with-lease origin master . I highly recommend that you make new branch for each changes, so you can work on something else while other PR is still waiting for approval. . Before creating a new branch, pull the changes from upstream. Your master needs to be up to date. . git pull . Create the branch on your local machine and switch in this branch : . git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch] . Push the branch on github : . git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch] .
